# What is this project about
This project is about learning OpenGL on a deeper level. I want to learn different render techniques
and why some is better than others, I want to learn more about shaders and how to create cool effects etc. 
I will also try to add some logic to it due to the fact that i'm studying game programming and i want to learn more
how to intertwine logic and 3D graphics.
