# What is this project about
This project is about learning OpenGL on a deeper level. I want to learn different render techniques
and why some is better than others, I want to learn more about shaders and how to create cool effects etc. 
I will also try to add some logic to it due to the fact that i'm studying game programming and i want to learn more
how to intertwine logic and 3D graphics.

# Update 28/11-2018
Fixed bug in renderer, now it renders more efficient.<br> 
Cached the model matrix for each game object and re-used that if the position, rotation or scale haven't been changed<br>
which increased the overall performance.<br>
Added some fog.<br>
